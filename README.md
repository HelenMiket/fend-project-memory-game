## Instructions

This Memory Game Project builds a complete browser-based card matching game. The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. 

Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how many moves it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.

When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.

A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
